# Christmas of Code 

These are a collection of my solutions for various Christmas calendars, mostly
consisting of terribly un-idiomatic code and awful solutions. You have been
warned. The repository is on a year by year basis, with
[2018](https://github.com/sondr3/ChristmasOfCode/tree/master/2018) being written
in Rust and [2019](https://github.com/sondr3/ChristmasOfCode/tree/master/2019)
written in Haskell.

## Words of advice

My code is awful, please don't use it.

## LICENSE

I dedicate my solutions to the public domain under the
[Unlicense](https://unlicense.org/) license.
