# Christmas of Code [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/sondr3/ChristmasOfCode.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/sondr3/ChristmasOfCode)

These are my solutions to various advent coding challenges, mostly Advent of
Code but also some from a company called knowit. To run the various solutions
you can do `cargo run -p aoc18 --bin day01`, or do `cargo test` to verify that
all my solutions are correct. That's kinda neat.

## Words of advice

My code is awful, please don't use it.

## LICENSE

I dedicate my solutions to the public domain under the
[Unlicense](https://unlicense.org/) license.
